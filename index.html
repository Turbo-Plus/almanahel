                        <p>he Definitive Guide, 3rd Edition, provides you with a comprehensive guide to CSS
                            implementation,
                            along with a thorough review of all aspects of CSS 2.1 ...<span class="dots">
                                Updated to cover Internet Explorer 7, Microsoft's
                                vastly improved browser, this new edition includes content on positioning, lists and
                                generated content, table layout, user interface, paged media, and more.
                                Simply put, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a way to separate a document's structure
                                from its presentation.
                                The benefits of this can be quite profound:
                                CSS allows a much richer document appearance than HTML and also saves
                                time--you can create or change the appearance of an entire document in just one place;
                                and its compact file size makes web pages load quickly.

                                Author Eric Meyer tackles the subject with passion, exploring in detail each individual
                                CSS property and how it interacts with other properties.
                                You'll not only learn how to avoid common mistakes in interpretation,
                                you also will benefit from the depth and breadth of his experience and his clear and
                                honest style. This is the complete sourcebook on CSS.

                                The 3rd edition contains:

                                Updates to reflect changes in the latest draft version of CSS 2.1
