                It doesn't need a high IQ, or reams of knowledge, or a great personality. All it needs is creativity, 
                imagination and empathy - all techniques that anyone can learn. Here Edward de Bono,
                 world-famous for changing the way people think, shows you in a clear,
                 practical language how to impress people with simple conversational tactics.
                
                Want to be irresistable? Then follow de Bono's advice: you won't believe how much it can revolutionise your life until you do.

                along with a thorough review of all aspects of CSS 2.1. Updated to cover Internet Explorer 7, Microsoft's 
               vastly improved browser, this new edition includes content on positioning, lists and generated content, table layout, user interface, paged media, and more.
               Simply put, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a way to separate a document's structure from its presentation. 
               The benefits of this can be quite profound:
                CSS allows a much richer document appearance than HTML and also saves 
               time--you can create or change the appearance of an entire document in just one place; and its compact file size makes web pages load quickly.
