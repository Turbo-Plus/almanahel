                    creativity,

                    practical language how to impress people with simple conversational tactics.

                    Want to be irresistable? Then follow de Bono's advice: you won't believe how much it can

                    CSS implementation,
                    along with a thorough review of all aspects of CSS 2.1. Updated to cover Internet Explorer 7,
                    Microsoft's
                    vastly improved browser, this new edition includes content on positioning, lists and generated

                    Simply put, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a way to separate a document's structure from its
                    presentation.
                    The benefits of this can be quite profound:
                    CSS allows a much richer document appearance than HTML and also saves
                    time--you can create or change the appearance of an entire document in just one place; and its
                    compact file size makes web pages load quickly.

                    Joining the professional web designers and programmers are new audiences who need to know a little
                    bit of code at work

                    blogs more attractive.

                    Introduces HTML and CSS in a way that makes them accessible to everyone—hobbyists, students, and
                    professionals—and it’s full-color throughout
                    Utilizes information graphics and lifestyle photography to explain the topics in a simple way that
                    is engaging
                    Boasts a unique structure that allows you to progress through the chapters from beginning to
                    end or just dip into topics of particular interest at your leisure
                    This educational book is one that you will enjoy picking up, reading, then referring back to.
                    It will make you wish other technical topics were presented in such a simple, attractive and
                    engaging way!
